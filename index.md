The answers to the following four prompts, which are meant to help you brainstorm for your Quarter 2 Project Proposal, due on December 2nd. 
For each prompt, state the question that you’re answering in bold and write your answer immediately underneath on a new line. 
Make sure you’ve familarized yourself with the Quarter 2 Project Proposal specifications before proceeding!

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter was model distillation. I thought that the idea of condensing the learning from larger models to smaller, more purpose built ones, is cool. 

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

I would like to work on a system to automate research. I want to create an LLM that can do research given a prompt. It will generate search queries, pull results, and filter through each result determining whether its body contains relevant information to the prompt. We will use an evaluation set to benchmark the model used to make sure it is working correctly. Next, we would extract all of the links from each source and classify again. In this way, we can recursively generate a graph structure representing the space of all useful information to a given prompt on the internet. 

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

If I could change anything about my Q1 project, I would make spend more time doing literature review to come up with a novel model for data homogenization. That being said, I would not change anything given the time constraints. If I had another 3 months to do the project I would spend some more time reading papers. 

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I would be interested in using process reward models. I'm also curious about using techniques to fine tune models using rule-based generated data.
